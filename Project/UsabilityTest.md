# Usability Test: Mercury Package Manager
## Team A | Fall 2020
### Jake Boers | Emily Costa | Ben DeVries | Andrew Feikema | Coleman Ulry | and Jack Westel

## Introduction
Thank you for agreeing to do this usability test for our new app, Mercury. We would love to see first-hand how our users navigate around the app. Our goal is to make our app as user-friendly as possible.

We’re testing the app, not you. You can’t do anything wrong here. We want to hear exactly what you're thinking, so don’t worry about hurting our feelings. Your constructive feedback will help us find problems and to solve them.

For the test, we will ask you to think out loud as we ask you to complete specific tasks. If you have questions, just ask. If you have comments, go ahead and say them outloud. We will record your comments, but we will not make them public. If, for any reason, you’d like to stop this test, just say so.

## Background Questions
We presume that you’re someone who owns a smartphone and are comfortable with using it. Are you currently living on Calvin University's Campus, or, have you in the past? Have you ever received a package and had to pick it up from the front desk? How was that process? Was there anything that caused some confusion? Was there anything that seemed unnecessarily difficult?

Or, are you or have you been a deskie at Calvin University? How is the process of managing the packages? Do you like the spreadsheet and Google form that you must fill out?

Before we begin, do you have any questions for me?

## The Test
1. Reactions to the Login Screen – Tell us your first impressions. Are you confused by anything? What are your eyes drawn to?

2. General Tasks - I’ll ask you to do some of the following tasks, depending upon how much time we have together:

    1. Say you are a resident, complete the following tasks:
        1. Log in as a resident, use any username and password.
        2. You want to know if you have any packages currently available for pick up. Find this information.
        3. You want to see all of your packages, including ones that have already been picked up. Find this information.
        4. You want to pick up your package today, but you don’t know the deskie hours. Find this information.
    2. Say you are a deskie, complete the following tasks:
        1. Log in as a deskie, use the username "deskie" and any password.
        2. The desk has just received a large white envelop for Emily Costa (eac2). Add this package to the system.
        3. You want to look at the packages that still need to be picked up by "eac2". Find this information.
        4. You want to look at all packages that "ajf34" has already picked up and are still waiting to be picked up. Find this information.
        5. You are also a resident, and you need to check to see if you personally have any packages to pick up. Find this information.


3. Final Observations – What are your concluding thoughts? Did the app have a nice feel to it? Was anything confusing to you as a first-time user? Would you consider using this app?

## Thank You
Thank you for your willingness to help us test our new Mercury Package Management app. This app is relatively new, and we would love for Calvin's Residence Halls to use it. We value your feedback, and we apprecaite your time.

We’ll contact you soon with a summary of what we found and how we hope to use it to improve the app. We’ll keep the data from your individual session private and will only release aggregate data.
