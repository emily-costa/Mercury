I asked my RAs and other residents in my building, and I came up with
some sample user stories. 


As a Deskie/RA I sould be able to...
    - Quickly enter the information describing the package
    - Send an automated notification email when finished logging the package 
      (My RA showed me the google form they use for logging the 
      packages, and they actually have to find and type out the 
      student's entire Calvin email themsleves, which is time consuming and 
      it also creates room for human error) 
    - Receive an automatic identification number to put on the box
      (After logging the box, the RA has to find an id # that isn't 
      already being used, which is also time consuming)
    - View a history of picked up packages (sometimes students forget they have
      already picked up a package)
    - View a history of who logged and handed out a package


As a resident I should be able to...
    - Receive a notification that my package is at the front desk 
    - Receive a notificaiton that my package has been picked up
    - See a history of the packages I have received and picked up
    - See the desk hours for that specific day
