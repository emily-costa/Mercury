# Client Side Application for Mercury Package Manager

Mercury Package Manager is an app for Calvin University aiding in logging packages for on-campus residents and notifiying the resident when a package has arrived for them.

I designed and coded the majority of the front-end UI design. I also worked on connecting the front-end to the back-end data service, so you can create, read, and update package data.
